\section sibr_projects_about What are the projects ?

Research algorithms and toolboxes have been implemented for SIBR as plugins named "Projects".
Unstructured Lumigraph Rendering (ULR) application is provided by default with SIBR to help users get started.
Some projects called toolboxes might also be used by other projects to bring additional functionalities (for instance the SIBR/Optix integration).

\subsection sibr_projects_documentation Access projects documentation

Each project documentation is compilable through SIBR.
To access the projects documentation, first :
- Add the project to SIBR like explained in \ref sibr_projects_add
- Compile the documentation 

\subsection sibr_projects_add Adding projects to SIBR

Existing projects can be added as subdirectories in the src/projects directory.
For this, you need to access to the project's source code (most of them are in https://gitlab.inria.fr/sibr/projects) to clone it, build it with SIBR and use it.
If you want to create your own project, see \ref howto_setup_project.
You can follow the given steps to add a project once access is given.
- You will need to checkout SIBR Core source code (see \ref sibr_checkout).
- Go to src/projects
- Clone/Copy the project source code in the correct project folder (it should be the same as the project repository, or check the README for more information).
- You can then resume with \ref sibr_generate_documentation or \ref sibr_compile

\subsection sibr_project_structure Project structure

See \ref project_structure

\subsection sibr_your_project Creating your own project

See \ref howto_setup_project

\subsection sibr_projects_available Projects available

Following this is the list of projects that have been added to this generated version of SIBR's documentation.\n
For projects that led to publications, the link to the paper is available.\n
Most of other projects are helper libraries that can be used to augment SIBR with new functionalities.\n
